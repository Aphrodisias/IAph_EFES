{"name":"Kiln","tagline":"Kiln is a multi-platform framework for building and deploying complex websites whose source content is primarily in XML. It brings together various independent software components into an integrated whole that provides the infrastructure and base functionality for such sites.","body":"Kiln is developed and maintained by a team at the Department of Digital Humanities (DDH), Kingâ€™s College London. Over the past years and versions, Kiln has been used to generate more than 50 websites which have very different source materials and customised functionality.\r\n\r\nKiln builds upon [Apache Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/), [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and [Sesame](http://www.openrdf.org/) to provide high quality implementations of common elements of rich web applications.\r\n\r\nKiln's documentation is available online at [Read the Docs](http://kiln.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
