        <body><p>The Inscriptions of Aphrodisias: a history</p>
            <div type="text">
                <p xml:id="intro">The first study devoted to the history of the inscriptions of Aphrodisias was
            a small volume by J. M. R. Cormack (<ref target="../concordance/bibliography/cormack1955.html">Cormack, 1955</ref>) written while he was preparing the inscriptions recorded by
            his teacher, William Calder, for publication (as <hi rend="italic">MAMA</hi> 8). The relevance of such material was
            illuminated by the work of Louis Robert, in the discussion of
            visitors to Caria in <ref target="../concordance/bibliography/robert1954.html"><title level="m">La Carie</title></ref>, and to 
                   Aphrodisias in <ref target="../concordance/bibliography/robert1965.html">
<title>Hellenica</title> 13</ref>,
            109-16; the background to one group of texts was set out by J. M. Reynolds, <ref target="../concordance/bibliography/jmr1982.html">
               <hi rend="italic">Aphrodisias and Rome</hi>
            </ref>, Appendix II, 147-8. Since then, new material has emerged; what follows is an
            account of the current state of our knowledge.</p>

         <p xml:id="byzantine">In the Byzantine period, probably in the ninth century, at least two,
            possibly three epigrams inscribed at the site were included in the <emph>Greek Anthology</emph>
               (<hi rend="italic">Anthologia Palatina</hi> 9.704, 16.35, and perhaps 7.690)<!-- ; see
               H. Beckby, <hi rend="italic">Anthologia Graeca</hi>
            (Munich, <emph>1957</emph>) I.2, 75 ff -->. They may may have been transcribed from the
            stone by a Byzantine copyist; but it is also possible that they circulated separately
            within the literary tradition.</p>

               <p>
<emph>William Sherard</emph> (See <ref target="https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/25355">DNB</ref> entry), while British Consul at Smyrna, visited the site on
                  two occasions; his own and related notebooks are in the British Library, bound as
                  BL Add. 10101-2. Understanding of his copies has been transformed by the work of
                  Michael Crawford; see <ref target="https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/000375821">Crawford, 2002</ref>, and <ref target="https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001270874">Crawford, 2003</ref>

               <div xml:id="sherard1"><head>1705, 19 to 23 August </head>

               <p>Sherard visited several sites,
                  including Geira/Aphrodisias, accompanied by <emph>Rev. John Tisser</emph>, <emph>Mr. Cutts Lockwood</emph>, <emph>Mr. John Lethieullier</emph> and <emph>Dr. Antonio Picenini</emph>. Picenini kept a diary
                  (BL Add. 6269, ff 38-49) and made copies (BL Add. 10102, ff. 12-53; Aphrodisias
                  13-36); he also transcribed the copies made by Tisser (10102, ff. 53-81,
                  Aphrodisias 53-56v, 61v-68, 71-77). Sherard made some copies of his own (BL Add.
                  10101 ff 9-21, Aphrodisias 9-16v); he also transcribed the copies made by Picenini
                  (ff. 22-67, Aphrodisias 24-48v). The resultant MS (BL Add. 10101, ff. 9-78v), is
                  referred to by Boeckh as Cod. Ask 1.
                  Picenini also gave a copy of the inscriptions he had copied to E. Spanheim, the
                  Prussian Ambassador to London, and this is now in the Staatsbibliothek, Berlin (MS
                  Spanhem. 11); this was also consulted by Boeckh in the preparation of <ref target="../concordance/bibliography/cigII.html"><title>Corpus
                     Inscriptionum Graecarum</title> II.2</ref></p></div>

            
            
               <div  xml:id="sherard2"><head>1716</head>
               <p>Sherard went on an expedition
                  around June 20 with <emph>Rev. Dr. S.
                  Lisle</emph>, (BL Add. 10101 ff. 68-78); he did not visit Aphrodisias. He set off on
                  a second expedition, from 5-25 July, with Dr. Lisle, <emph>Mr. Vandervecht</emph>, and <emph>J.C., probably Jos.
                     Clotterboke</emph> (10101, 119-131v, Cod. Ask. 3) as well as <emph>Bernard Mould</emph> (whose diary is BL
                  Add. 65412); this took him to Aphrodisias on 6 July, and almost all the
                  inscriptions copied on that expedition are from there (10101, 120-131).</p>
               <p>
Picenini's and Sherard's copies were used by 
                     <emph> E. Chishull</emph> (see <ref target="https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/5328">DNB entry</ref>) in

                     behalf of Boeckh, for the preparation of <ref target="../concordance/bibliography/cigII.html"><title>Corpus

<emph>Robert 'Palmyra' Wood</emph> (see <ref target="https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/29891">DNB entry</ref>) visited the site and copied some twenty texts; these
                  copies were never published, but are all of texts which have been published
                  elsewhere. The papers are now in the possession of the Society for the Promotion
